# ZX-Spectrum-Component-Video
Component video (YPbPr) output for the ZX Spectrum computer 

## Objective

This hardware modification is a more compact version of the solution that uses an A-Video board with seperate level shifters.
It tries to solve various shortcomings of https://github.com/c0pperdragon/A-VideoBoard/tree/master/zxspectrummod :

- Smaller and cheaper to make
- No need to modify the case of the ZX Spectrum
- No need to remove any components besides the RF modulator.
